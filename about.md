### Overview

In this application we will investigate the properties of the exponential distribution in R. We will use the rexp R function to generate the exponential random deviates for a certain number of simulations. The parameters that can be varied for the simulation are : N(sample size), lambda and the no of simulation. The application will allow the user to investigate the following 
- Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
- Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
- Show that the distribution of the sample means is approximately normal.
