### Conclusion

As we note in Fig. above the distribution of sample means pretty closely resembles a normal distibution. The red line indicates the theoretical mean and the blue line indicates the observed mean from the simulation. They are pretty close. A normal probability plot of the sample means also closely form around a straight line indicating normality. This result can be explained by the Central Limit Theorem.
